 # Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) Scanning and Advertising 
 - Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), available in Android 4.3 and later
 - Creates short connections between devices to transfer bursts of data
 - Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) conserves power by remaining in sleep mode most of the time
 - It wakes up only to make advertisements and short connections
